            <h1> About me and other information </h1>
            <p>Hi everyone, my name is Nicholas Hammond and this is my about section on my Programming portfolio.<br>
                Here I will tell you a little about me and the things I enjoy and what I do in my free time. <br> 
                For starters I was born and raised in Burrillville, Rhode Island as was my older sister. <br> 
                During my time in high school I spent most of my time hanging out with friends, playings <br> 
                sports, or hanging out on the lake with my family. The two sports I play are soccer and lacrosse, <br> 
                I spent four years on the varsity team for both sports. Some other things I enjoy are my cats! <br> 
                One is named Dakota she is a small chubby little tabby cat and the other is a big long orange cat <br> 
                named Colby. As of right now I am a student at the University of Rhode Island. <br>
