            <p> Hi, my name is Nicholas Hammond, welcome to my CS portfolio webpage. <br> 
                On this webpage you will find all of the work I have completed and the work I am working on,  in javascript.<br>
                You can also find the specific apps I have worked on throughout this class. <br>
                The final tab you find on this webpage will be an about me section where I tell you all a little bit about myself and who I am as a person.
